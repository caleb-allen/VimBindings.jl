### Motions
Commands for moving the cursor.

A motion command may be prepended with a `count` to repeat the motion, for example the motion `3w` moves 3 words to the right.

### Operators
A motion can be used in after an operator to have the command operate on the text in the motion.

> | Command | Description | Implemented                                                              |
> |---------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | `c`       | change      | ‚úÖ                                                                        |
> | `d`       | delete      | ‚úÖ                                                                        |
> | `y`       | yank        | üöß (see [issue](https://github.com/caleb-allen/VimBindings.jl/issues/3)) |

An operator may be prepended with a `count` to repeat the operation. For example, `3dW` will execute the `dW` operation 3 times.

### Text Objects
Text object commands can only be used after an operator. Commands that start with `a` select "a"n object including white space, the commands starting with `i` select an "inner" object without white space, or just the white space. Thus the "inner" commands always select less text than the "a" commands.

Definitions of text objects:
- word: a word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with whitespace (spaces, tabs, newline). For example, the words in the text `function hello()` are `function`, `hello`, and `()`.
- WORD: a WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with whitespace. For example, the WORDs in the text `function hello()` are `function` and `hello()`.

### Undo and Redo

VimBindings.jl implements the core semantics of undo and redo as implemented by vim, with the exception that VimBindings.jl does not implement an undo tree or undo branches. Undo/redo is implemented as a list.

The undo and redo implementation is not vi compatible; "uu" will undo two times, like in vim, rather than "undoing" an undo as in vi.
